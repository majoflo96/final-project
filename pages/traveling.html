          I decided to dedicate a page for my traveling passion. This way I want you to connect with me on a more personal level.
          My idea is to get photos of myself from all around the world. I want to take a photo with myself on it in every country I've travelled to.
          <br><br>
          I do miss a lot of photos from a lot of countries because I came up with this idea a little bit too late. Please check it frequently for updates.
          I might also find some older photos and I will update this page when I do. Of course another way to keep up to date is by following me on Instagram.

                I´ve been in Switzerland 5 times. I studied in a boarding school in Montreux when I was younger. My favorite thing to do over there is spend time with nature like hiking in the mountains. Switzerland has one of the most amazing views.
